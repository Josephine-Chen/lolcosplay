# LoL Cosplay #
MVP project for HackReactor.

##About##
LoLCosplay is a site designed for League of Legends cosplayers to filter through the champions and their skins by features, such as hair color and length and amount of armor, in order to choose a champion to cosplay. This feature is useful for those who have wigs used for other cosplays, those who want to make a group of champions from the same faction, theme, or class, etc.

Once a champion or skin is chosen, users are able to find guides and tutorials that can help them create the costume or prop. General tutorials will be available for users who want to learn more about subjects such as adding electronics or constructing better armor. Users will be able to submit their photos to a gallery for each champion so others may use their cosplays as reference.
