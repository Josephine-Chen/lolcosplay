<div id='faq'>
<h5>Why isn't X available as an option?</h5>
X isn't available as an option because we manually input the tags for champions and skins. The released champions/skins list is current as of XX/XX/XX.
<br>
<h5>Will you support custom skins?</h5>
No, at least not for the filter. You can design anything you want as a custom skin which will clutter up the main filter when people have many interpretations of an idea. We may implement a gallery functionality to store custom skins.
<br>
<h5>Can I submit a reference/gallery image?</h5>
Sure! Just fill out a form below.
<br>
<h5>I don't agree with this tagging! Can you change it?</h5>
Fill out a form below with a reason why you disagree.
<br>
<h5>This reference is a broken link/is not relevant.</h5>
Flag the reference on the page and we will fix it.
